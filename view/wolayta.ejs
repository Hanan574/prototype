        <h3>Early history</h3>
        Wolayta people are renowned for having had over fifty monarchs in three dynasties. The Wolaita monarchs were called Kawo. The Wolayta people are proud to have ruled over separate and sovereign kingdoms from the thirteenth century. One of the deadliest conflicts of Menelik's whole time of expansion was the war of resistance spearheaded by the last Kawo of Wolaita, which culminated to the integration of the Wolaita Kingdom and other Southern nations into the Ethiopian Empire. The Wolaita's military organization's power was demonstrated by their military opposition and rejection of Menelik's generals. In 1894, Ethiopia triumphed over the Wolaita people during the most bloody conflict, which Emperor Menelik personally commanded.</p>
