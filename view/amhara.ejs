        <h3>Topography</h3>
        The Amhara area is situated in the northwest of Ethiopia around 9°–14° N and 36°–40° E. Three main agricultural climatic zones make up the region: lowland (below 1,500 metres above sea level), semi-highland (1,500 to 2,300 metres above sea level), highland (above 2,300 metres above sea level), which account for 20%, 44%, and 28% of the total. Diversified agriculture thrives in this diverse ecosystem. The terrain of the area is made up of plains, gorges, plateaus and hills. The highest point in the area is 4,620 metres, which is located at the summit of Ras Dashen. The lowest point is 500 metres. Africa's fourth-highest peak, Ras Dashen peak, is located in the North Gondar administrative zone.

        <h3>Early history</h3>
        The Amhara people are one of the major ethnic groups in Ethiopia, with a rich and complex history that spans thousands of years. Here's an overview of the history of the Amhara people:

Ancient Origins: The origins of the Amhara people can be traced back to ancient times when various ethnic groups inhabited the Ethiopian highlands. The Amhara are believed to be one of the indigenous peoples of the region, with linguistic and cultural ties to the ancient Semitic-speaking populations of the area.

Kingdom of Aksum: The Amhara region was part of the Aksumite Kingdom, one of the most powerful civilizations in the ancient world. The Aksumites were known for their advanced civilization, including their architecture, trade networks, and adoption of Christianity in the 4th century AD.

Zagwe Dynasty: In the 12th century, the Zagwe Dynasty emerged in the Amhara region, establishing its capital at Lalibela. The Zagwe rulers are known for their construction of monolithic rock-hewn churches, which are UNESCO World Heritage sites today.

Solomonic Dynasty and Ethiopian Empire: The Zagwe Dynasty was eventually overthrown by the Solomonic Dynasty in the 13th century, which claimed descent from the biblical King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. The Solomonic Dynasty established the Ethiopian Empire, with the Amhara serving as one of its dominant ethnic groups.

Expansion and Consolidation: Under the Solomonic Dynasty, the Ethiopian Empire expanded its territory, incorporating diverse ethnic groups and establishing a centralized monarchy. The Amhara played a significant role in the administration, military, and cultural life of the empire, which reached its zenith during the reign of Emperor Tewodros II in the 19th century.

European Colonialism and Italian Occupation: In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Ethiopia faced threats from European colonial powers, particularly Italy. Ethiopia successfully resisted Italian colonization attempts, culminating in the victory at the Battle of Adwa in 1896, which secured Ethiopia's status as one of the few African nations to maintain independence during the colonial era.

Modern Era: In the 20th century, Ethiopia underwent significant political changes, including the overthrow of Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and the establishment of a Marxist-Leninist government. The Amhara, along with other ethnic groups, experienced political and social upheaval during this period.

Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) Era: In 1991, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) overthrew the Marxist-Leninist government and established a federal system that recognized the country's ethnic diversity. The Amhara, along with other ethnic groups, have been part of Ethiopia's political landscape in the post-EPRDF era.

        <h3>Religion</h3>
        Coptic Monophysite Christians make up the Amhara people. Since the fourth century AD, the populace has been converted to Christianity, and not much has changed in terms of the religion's original form in Ethiopia. Due to the writing method of the ancient Amhara civilization, a multitude of manuscripts containing the old Christian teachings in a language that is still used by the church today have been preserved. It's called Geez. Latin in the Roman Catholic Church serves a comparable purpose to Geez, as the language is only utilised within the framework of Amhara Christianity.
