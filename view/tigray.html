        <h3>Topography</h3>
        Tigray is the northernmost region of Ethiopia, Africa's second most
        populated country. It is landlocked and surrounded by Eritrea, Sudan,
        and Ethiopia's Afar and Amhara provinces. Tigray is noted for its hilly
        terrains, which have frequently aided the locals in defending their
        region against invaders like as the Greeks, Turks, and Italians.

        <h3>Early history</h3>
        Although Tigray is attributed with originating Ethiopian civilization, it was not the cause of the current Ethiopian state's unification. Tigray's history dates back to approximately 980 BC, when it gave rise to the D'mt (Daʿəmat) Kingdom, which ruled over what is now Tigray and Eritrea from approximately 980 BC to approximately 400 BC. The capital of D'mt was Yeha, which is home to the Great Temple of Yeha, Palace Grat Be’al Gebri, and Necropolis of Daro Mikael, which has rock-cut tombs.The history of Tigray dates back to approximately 980 BC, when the D'mt (Daʿəmat) Kingdom existed.

        <h3>Religion</h3>
        The majority of Ethiopians are Orthodox Christians. 95.6% of people practise it. The Axumite Empire was centred around Orthodox Christianity. Some scriptural accounts identify an Axumite ruler as one of the Three Wise Kings.
The cross design was originally used on state coins in Axum.
The first emperor of the Solomonic Dynasty, which began in Tigray, was Menelik I, son of King Solomon of Israel and Queen Sheba (Saba). He is said to have taken the Ark of the Covenant, which is now kept concealed in the St. Mary Zion Church in Axum. The church is located not far from the Obelisks of Axum, which are 80-foot-tall granite and steel tombstones that date back 1,700 years.
